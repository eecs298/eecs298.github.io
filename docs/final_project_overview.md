# Introduction

The goal of the final group project is to integrate everything you’ve learned into the examination of a sociotechnical system of your choice.  Each group will tackle a particular sociotechnical system of interest and create something new.  You will use the tools and ideas discussed throughout this course to analyze the social consequences of computing in that particular domain.  You will write code to either a) help analyze the harm in this sociotechnical system using data or b) make an app or algorithm that, if you were to deploy it in the the sociotechnical system, would help mitigate that harm.  This is your chance to get creative!  You are strongly encouraged to talk to course staff about your ideas before settling on a project.

# Overview

Here's what you will do:

- Pick a sociotechnical system.  It should be a system relevant to this course which includes the potential for a computing technology to have social consequences.

- Describe the salient issues and harms in this sociotechnical system.

- Pick a harm in the system.  It should be a kind of harm with social consequences we have discussed in class: an ethical issue, a privacy violation, etc.

- Write code to either a) closely analyze the harm in this sociotechnical system using data or b) make an app or algorithm that, if you were to deploy it in the sociotechnical system, would help mitigate that harm.  There must be a significant part of your project written in Python, but it does not need to be entirely written in Python.  (For example, an app or website may have a Python backend, but the frontend would not be in Python.)

- If you did a data analysis, evaluate potential solutions to your issue using your analysis, and if you built an app or other code, evaluate and critique your own solution by using concepts from class.

- Submit your work.  See below for what must be submitted.

# Outputs

There are three intermediate graded assignments to help make sure you are on track to finish on time.  These due dates are meant to represent the latest dates estimated to enable you to finish on time; making more progress earlier is certainly recommended.

- [Code of conduct]({% link final_project_conduct.md %}) (due Feb. 14)

- [A project description]({% link final_project_description.md %}) (due March 8)

- [A project outline]({% link final_project_outline.md %}) (due March 29)

Due at the end of the semester (April 22), there are three graded outputs to submit:

- A written report

- An oral presentation

- Your project code (as well as any data or other materials that are part of your project)

## Project Description (due March 8)

Your first task is to come up with a plan for your final project.  As described above, you will need to choose a sociotechnical system, a harm in that system, and come up with an idea for what you will code.  You should keep in mind that you will need a project you can complete before the end of the semester, but is sufficiently ambitious to successfully mitigate or better understand a harm in your sociotechnical system.  We expect this to be an iterative process -- you are strongly encouraged to talk to course staff before settling on a project.

You will turn in a summary (typed, no more than one page) of your plan for the final project.  This summary should include a brief description of the following:

- Your sociotechnical system and a harm in that sociotechnical system

- What you plan to do and build

- What you will need to accomplish your plan (has anyone previously tried to mitigate this harm? data? infrastructure?)

- Your plan for the rest of the semester to complete this project, including any internal deadlines you will need to meet to accomplish your plan

- Who will do what

 This summary will be graded based on how well-specified your plan is, though you do not need to go into more detail than one page will allow.

## Project Outline (due March 29)

This assignment will be your last check-in for the final project before it is due, and it will include two things: the first part of your written report and a “minimum working product”.

Your minimum working product/example will be the smallest piece of code, data, etc. you need to demonstrate that your proposed approach will be feasible, and any outputs from your code so far that demonstrate feasbility, which you can include in the written report.

You will be graded based on successfully showing that your project is on track and communicating effectively.

## Written Report

The written report will describe your project:

- an analysis of the salient issues in your sociotechnical system

- your methodology to analyze a harm in this system/mitigate a harm in this system

- a description of your project (what you coded, etc.)

- the results of your project, and an evaluation of your results

- recommendations for future improvements to your creation

## Presentation

The oral presentation will be delivered at the end of the semester to explain what you did and why, overviewing what is included in the written report, and where appropriate, including a demonstration of your creation.

## Project Code

You will also submit everything you did for your project:  all code written, data collected, etc.  There must be a significant part of your project written in Python, but it does not need to be entirely written in Python.  (For example, an app or website may have a Python backend, but the frontend would not be in Python.)

# Submission

Everything will be submitted to Gradescope as a group.  Make sure to enter all of your teammates 
in the prompt when submitting.  You will be graded as a group.  Details for submission will be on Gradescope.

# Examples
Below are a few examples of what you might want to aspire to, although these are largely to serve as inspirations:  you may choose very different topics or styles.

Example student projects:

- An analysis of discrimination in algorithmic pre-employment assessments

- A classifier to detect bots on Instagram

- An app to crowd-source reviews of content from your social network to combat misinformation

- An analysis of how generative AI employs stereotypes in images

- An analysis of price transparency rules by examining machine-readable prices published by hospitals

And here are a few examples from the professionals.  You may not be able to achieve the same level of polish or ambition in the time allotted, but they might help to inspire you.
