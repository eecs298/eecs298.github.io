# Introduction

At the end of the semester, you will submit a written report on your project (along with all of your code and any other products) and give a presentation on your project.  A successful project and report will identify a meaningful harm in a sociotechnical system relevant to this course, correctly apply concepts and theory from class to the project, and provide a detailed analysis and/or mitigation of that harm using your code and any other products.

# Written Report
Your final report will describe the entirety of your project.  It should be no shorter than approximately 8 pages (as usual, in a reasonable format like 12pt single-spaced, or around 3000 words).  Note most of these sections were also required in your outline, but they should be expanded as necessary based on what you ended up accomplishing in your project.  As a result, the instructions below have been expanded, so please make sure to read carefully.  There are also two new sections your report should include:  results and discussion.  You may include additional sections or choose to organize in the manner you think most effective, but the report must include everything below:

### Introduction

The first section should effectively introduce the reader to the project:

- What is the topic of your project?  Be as specific as possible.  Why is this topic important?
- What question(s) did you answer (or at least tackled) by completing this project?  These questions should be about mitigating the harm in a particular sociotechnical system you picked to tackle in this project.
- Why is it important to answer these questions?
- What are your main conclusions from your project?  Your conclusions should use the answers to your questions and should be about the harm you are analyzing or mitigating.
- Briefly summarize what you did in this project and how you drew the conclusions you did.
- Briefly summarize the implications of your conclusions.  Are there any future applications of your work?

### Background
An expanded description of your sociotechnical system of your choice, including a description of both the stakeholders and social aspects of the system, and a description of the technical aspects of the system.  Use the relevant features of sociotechnical systems we discussed in class in your description.  Also include a description of the harm you are tackling in this system.  Why is this harm relevant to this course?  The description need not be an exhaustive description of every single aspect of the system, but should be enough to provide context for a discussion of the relevant issues observed in this sociotechnical system.

### Previous Work  
What is already known about the harms of this sociotechnical system?  You should provide an overview using readings from class, newspaper articles, white papers, and/or scholarly writing.  You should have a minimum of five cited sources, each relevant to the project.  Please see course staff for more guidance on how to find relevant sources.  This section should include:

- An overview of the known issues and harms that have occurred in this sociotechnical system.
- A description of what's already known about the particular harm you are tackling in this project.  Are there any real-life case studies of this harm you can describe?  Has there been any previous attempts to analyze or mitigate this harm? 
- How does your project build on this previous work?  Are you trying to answer a question raised by past work, reproduce a study, mitigate a harm demonstrated by past work, or something else entirely?

### Motivation
The introduction should have touched on motivation, but now is the chance to go into detail.  Why is your topic and chosen sociotechnical system important, and why are the questions you are asking about this particular harm important?  Make sure to use concepts/theory from class to make your argument.

### Methodology
How did you answer the questions you are asking?  This should be as detailed a methodology as possible: the goal is to make the methodology reproducible by another student, just by reading this section.  This should detail how you collected and cleaned data, the details of your app layout, the statistical tests you use to measure the effect of your intervention, etc. (not all of these will necessarily apply to your project, and this list is not exhaustive).  If your methodology changed between the outline and the final submission, make sure to update this.

Any ethical implications of your methodology should be discussed as well.  If you collected data, for example, what are the privacy implications of your collection process?

### Results
This section should include all of your results, answers to your original questions, and conclusions you can draw from your results about the harm you are investigating and/or mitigating.  What were your results?  If you are conducting a data analysis, what were the results of the analysis?  What were the results of any statistical tests you applied?  If you ran a survey, what was the outcome of the survey?  If you built an app, what does the finished product look like, and what were the results of any trial deployment?  (As before, not all of these will necessarily apply to your project, and this list is by no means exhaustive.)

This section should also include any evaluation of your results.  What conclusions can you draw?  What qualitative and quantitative evidence do you have from your results that support your conclusions?  Use concepts/theory from class to support your argument.  For example, if you want to conclude that your analyzed system violates privacy, you should include a detailed analysis of how the system violates privacy according to the conceptions of privacy discussed in class.

### Discussion and future work
This section should include a discussion of your project and results, implications of those results, limitations, and any future work that could expand this project.

- Implications:  What are the implications of your results?  How do your conclusions have implications for how we think about harm in your sociotechnical system?  Could there be any applications of your work to create solutions?
- Limitations:   What are the methodological limitations to your project?  What were you *not* able to accomplish in this project?  What would you have needed or what hurdles would you have had to overcome to accomplish this?
- Future work:  If you had the chance, how would you expand this project in the future?  Be as specific as possible.  Do you have any recommendations for future improvements to what you did?

## Written Report Rubric [60 pts., 15% overall]

**[4 pts.]** Makes a persuasive argument that this project tackles a harm in a sociotechnical system relevant to this course, and connects the harm to the relevant concepts from this course.
- The harm and sociotechnial system should be well-specified
- Details are included that connect the project to concepts from the course (e.g. conceptions of privacy, components of ML, etc.)

**[4 pts.]** Makes a persuasive argument that the project poses answerable and well-motivated questions about mitigation or analysis of a particular harm in a sociotechnical system by using concepts from class.

**[3 pts. for *each*]** Includes introduction, background, previous work, motivation, and discussion sections as described above.  (See below for methodology and results sections.)

**[4 pts.]** Includes a methodology section as described above.
- Methodology sufficiently detailed to be as reproducible (e.g. by another student) as possible
- Methodology capable of answering the project’s questions and goals (subject to the limitations described in the discussion section)
- Methodology addresses and engages with any conceptual challenges discussed in the course.  (For example, if the project is about creating a more private system, then the methodology should be sufficient to address the difficulties we discussed in class in understanding privacy norms in your sociotechnical system.)
- Ethical implications or other consequences of your methodology should be discussed and addressed wherever appropriate

**[4 pts.]** Includes a results section as described above.  Grading will not be based on the quantity of your results, or how novel they are, but rather the following:
- Results should be supported by your evidence
- Evidence is sufficiently complete to make a cogent argument that results in the stated conclusions
- Facts about the sociotechnical system and evidence provided are relevant to your argument
- The most significant and relevant evidence is not omitted
- Conclusions are justified by your results and concepts from the course

**[5 pts.]** The project must successfully apply theory and concepts from the course.
- Identifies the theory and/or concepts that are most relevant to the project and question(s) you are answering
- Correctly interprets the meaning and implication of the theory/concepts
- Correctly applies the theory/concepts to the project

**[4 pts.]** Clear and cogent writing that gets your points across. There should be a well-defined structure to the report that enables you to convince the reader of the importance of your questions and the logic of your argument and conclusions.  No, the use of language generation models is not allowed.
Clearly indicates all of the parts of your project as detailed above.
Report is well structured
Ensures fact-based claims are carefully cited (any citation format is acceptable);
Communicates effectively (with reasonable organization, effective language in full sentences, etc.).

**[20 pts.]** The code, data, and all other products successfully support the project.
- Significant Python code included
- The code and other products are effective at helping to answer the questions posed in this project, explore the topic, and provide a meaningful analysis or mitigation of the chosen harm in the sociotechnical system
- Code and other products should be well maintained and documented to the degree possible
- Ethics or other consequences of data collection and analysis is carefully considered in both the report and implementation
- All products necessary to support the project are included in the submission

# Code and Other Products

You will also submit all of your code and any other product (data, surveys, other files e.g. images in an app, etc.) as part of your final project.  There must be a significant portion of the code in Python, but it need not be entirely in Python.  The goal of the code is to investigate through analysis or mitigation of your chosen harm in a sociotechnical system.  Code and other products should be documented to the degree possible.  Ethics or other implications of the implementation of your products should be carefully considered and discussed in the report.

The grade for this part will be included as part of your final report grade; see above for the rubric.

# Presentation

In the final presentation, you will describe what you did for the final project.  It will be 20 minutes, with 5 minutes for questions/transitioning to the next presentation. (The only thing you have to submit are the slides from your presentation.)  You may divide up the work of creating this as you want to amongst your group members, but everyone in the group should speak in the presentation at least a little.  Make sure to take into account any feedback you received for your reading presentation.

The presentation will describe what you did for the project, including answering the following questions:

- What is the sociotechnical system and harm in that system you are tackling?
- What are the questions/problems you are addressing in this project?
- Why was your work important to do?
- What is (briefly) your methodology?
- What were your main findings?  (In the case that you are building an app, what does the app do, and demonstrate it if at all possible.)
- What broader implications does this have in society, and how do your main findings address an issue (or issues) raised throughout this course?
- What lessons should we take away from your work?
- What directions, if you were to continue this work in the future, would you want to explore?

## Presentation Rubric [16 pts., 8% overall]
**[10 pts.]** Successfully answers the above questions in your presentation and overviews your project and all of your hard work.

**[2 pts.]**  The presentation should aim to make an argument that you have successfully tackled a meaningful harm in a sociotechnical system via your project.
- Presentation should be well structured and have a clear flow
- Through answering the above questions, makes an argument for both the importance of your project and the conclusions that you draw

**[2 pts.]** Making clear and effective slides.  Slides should include content related to the material, but should also include some visual element nor be packed full of nothing but text.  (Slides are a visual medium, and if the slides are packed with bullet points full of writing, your audience's attention will be split between the slides and what you are saying.)

**[2 pts.]** Speaking clearly without overly relying on notes.  You certainly may use notes or the slides themselves to remind yourself of what you’re going to say, but you should not be reading word-for-word or as if you were reading from a book.

# Your Contribution (Optional)

This is optional, and not graded.

You may write a short description of how you personally contributed to the final project.  What did you do, and, very approximately, how long did it take?  I expect no more than a few paragraphs, and definitely no more than about a page.  Your description will be used to make sure you get credit for the work you did regardless of anyone else's effort.

If you do not submit this description, you final project grade will be based only on the final report and presentation.

This will be submitted separately from the rest of the final project on Gradescope.

# Submission

You will submit the written report, the code, and all other products as a .zip via Gradescope as a group. Gradescope has a rubric with points for this assignment. Make sure to enter all of your teammates in the prompt when submitting. You will be graded as a group.  All work should be cited; any citation format is acceptable.

Slides for the presentation must be submitted on Gradescope before the day of the presentation.
