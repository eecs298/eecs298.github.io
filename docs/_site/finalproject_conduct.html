            <h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>

<p>Your goal is to create a code of conduct for your final project team.
You will use the guideline, below, to create this code of conduct as
a team.  This should be a realistic document that your team abides by 
for the rest of the semester.  To think through the longer term 
consequences, you may create this code as if you were going  to continue 
this project indefinitely after the end of the semester (though if you 
actually choose to do so of course is entirely your choice).</p>

<p>While creating the code of conduct, it should be helpful to bear in mind
the following questions:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>How can a code of conduct help your team succeed?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What is the goal of this team? Which values will be most salient to
advancing this mission?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What types of behavior will not be tolerated? If such a behavior happens,
how will you be able to go back to this code of conduct to resolve
the issue?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Can you use the ACM Code of Ethics or other real-world examples (below)
to inspire your own?</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h1 id="submission">Submission</h1>

<p>You will submit your code of conduct via Gradescope as a group.  Gradescope has
a rubric with points for this assignment.  Make sure to enter all of your teammates 
in the prompt when submitting.  You will be graded as a group.  It should be around
2-3 pages (in a reasonable format like 12pt, single-spaced).  If you do reference any 
work that’s not your group’s (this is not required), it should be cited; any citation 
format is acceptable.</p>

<h1 id="real-world-examples">Real-World Examples</h1>

<p>Here are a few more real-world examples of codes of conduct outside of
the readings to help inspire you.</p>

<h1 id="code-of-conduct-guidelines">Code of Conduct Guidelines</h1>

<p>In creating a code of conduct, you should consider the following
questions.  You are encouraged to go beyond this list of questions to
create a thoughtful code of conduct, and add any other sections you see fit
in addition to the ones below.</p>

<h2 id="team-goals-and-responsibilities">Team Goals and Responsibilities</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Include the goals for this code of conduct, as well as a summary of it.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Assign responsibilities to each team member so that everybody knows what
they need to do.  Examples of responsibilities: Organizing meetings,
note-taking during meetings, making sure submissions happen on time, 
leading project decision making, writing &amp; editing, programming, etc.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Decide on how to organize your group, including when/how often meetings
occur, which forms of communication to use, etc.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="standards-best-practices-and-acceptable-behavior">Standards, Best Practices, and Acceptable Behavior</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Describe best practices for maintaining a strong sense of
community and inclusivity within the project.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Detail behaviors that lead to an inclusive and positive project and
team environment.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Outline what respectful, positive, and considerate conversations
look like, as well as any more general standards for signaling
an open and accepting environment.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>May include examples of positive situations and acceptable behavior.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="unacceptable-behavior">Unacceptable Behavior</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Define what actions or conversations should not be permitted in order to
maintain a positive working environment.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Provide examples of behavior by team members that would be
considered inappropriate for the project’s setting.  For example, this
may include threatening or bullying speech, insulting comments, or
poor communication with the rest of the team.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>May include any behavior specifically disallowed by the team during team
meetings and in your work.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="conflict-management-and-code-enforcement">Conflict Management and Code Enforcement</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Provide a brief outline of what to do if the code of conduct is
violated.  Consider both passive enforcement, where your team may 
only seek resolution when these guidelines have been violated, or 
actively, by asking team members to periodically reflect on
the document throughout the rest of the semester.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What instances of negative or harmful behavior should be resolved by
the group members, and how? Which situations should be resolved by
the team, and which should be addressed by course staff?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Describe courses of action that could be taken in cases where a team
member is not as active as required, or if a team member feels
uncomfortable with any conversations or work related to the project.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How does this code of conduct avoid simply becoming “security
theater," in which actions taken give the feeling of improving the
situation, while accomplishing little or nothing else?</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="ethics-and-scope">Ethics and Scope</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Describe potential ethical problems related to the development and
completion of your project.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What will happen once you release your project on the world? Who
will be responsible for maintaining the project and mitigating any
issues that arise?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Define the scope of this code of conduct.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What parts of this code of conduct apply both within project spaces and public spaces when an
individual is representing the project or its community? Does it
only apply within online settings, or does it apply to in-person
conversations?</p>
  </li>
</ul>
