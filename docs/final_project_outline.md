# Introduction

This assignment will be your last check-in for the final project before it is due, and it will include two things: the first part of your written report and a “minimum working product”.  The goal is to put together a "story" about why you're working on your project:  How is the problem your project tackling important (using concepts from class)?  What is already known about the sociotechnical system you have chosen, and how does that produce questions your project will answer?  What methodology will you use to answer those questions?

In order to make sure you can finish on time, it's helpful to start with a "minimum working product" -- a first piece of code, analysis, and/or data you can produce that demonstrates that your proposed methodology will be feasible in the time you have left.

You will be graded based on successfully completing the following:


# Written Report
Your final project will include a written report, which you will start now.  It should be no shorter than 4-5 pages (as usual, in a reasonable format like 12pt single-spaced).  For now, the written report will include:

- Your project:  What question(s) do you plan on answering by completing this project?  These questions should be about mitigating the harm in a particular sociotechnical system you picked to tackle in this project.

- Background:  An expanded description of your sociotechnical system of your choice, including a description of both the stakeholders and social aspects of the system, and a description of the technical aspects of the system.  Also include a description of the harm you are tackling in this system.  Why is this harm relevant to this course?  The description need not be an exhaustive description of every single aspect of the system, but should be enough to provide context for a discussion of the relevant issues observed in this sociotechnical system.

- Previous Work:  What is already known about the harms of this sociotechnical system?  You should provide an overview using readings from class, newspaper articles, white papers, and/or scholary writing.  You should have a minimum of five cited sources.  This section should include 1) an overview of the known issues and harms that have occurred in this sociotechnical system, and 2) a description of what's already known about the particular harm you are tackling in this project.  Are there any real-life case studies of this harm you can describe?  Has there been any previous attempts to analyze or mitigate this harm?

- Motivation:  Why are the questions you are asking about this harm important?  How are you building on previous work (or reproducing previous work or the like)?  Use concepts from class to make your argument.

- Methodology:  How will you answer the questions you are asking?  This should be as detailed a methodology as you can make: the goal is to make the methodology reproducible by another student, just by reading this section.  This is the time to work out all of the details, for example how you will clean any data you collect, the details of your app layout, the statistical tests you will use to measure the effect of your intervention, etc. (not all of these will necessarily apply to your project).

- Minimum working product:  A short description of what you did for your minimum working example.  How does this retire risk? (See below.)  If your minimum working product has any outputs that demonstrate your hoped-for results, include them here.

# Minimum Working Product
There's nothing worse than realizing something you had counted on to work won't, and there's no way to finish your project on time.  The goal of the minimum working product is to get started building, demonstrate that your proposed approach will be feasible, and to make sure the riskiest parts of your project will work before it's too late to pivot.  This means what the minimum working product will consist of will depend on where the risk is in your project, so make sure to carefully think about this choice.  Include in your submission the code (and any data or other components) that make up your minimum working product.

# Submission

You will submit the written report and the minimum working product as a .zip via Gradescope as a group. Gradescope has a rubric with points for this assignment. Make sure to enter all of your teammates in the prompt when submitting. You will be graded as a group. It should be one page (in a reasonable format like 12pt, single-spaced).  All work should be cited; any citation format is acceptable.

# Rubric

[2 pts.] Includes a description of the project, questions that the project will plan on answering,and background as described above.

[2 pts.] Includes previous work as described above.

[2 pts.] Makes a persuasive argument that the project poses answerable and well-motivated questions about mitigation or analysis of a particular harm in a sociotechnical system by using concepts from class.

[3 pts.] Details a reproducible methodology that can be carried out by the team and will answer the questions proposed in the project.

[5 pts.] Minimum working product successfully demonstrates the proposed approach and includes description of the working product as described above. 

[1 pt.] Features clear and cogent writing in a well-organized document.
