# Introduction

Your first major task is to come up with a plan for your final project.  As described above, you will need to choose a sociotechnical system, a harm in that system, and come up with an idea for what you will code.  You should keep in mind that you will need a project you can complete before the end of the semester, but is sufficiently ambitious to successfully mitigate or better understand a harm in your sociotechnical system.  We expect this to be an iterative process -- you are strongly encouraged to talk to course staff before settling on a project.

You will turn in a summary (typed, one page) of your plan for the final project.  This summary should include a brief description of the following:

- Your sociotechnical system and a harm in that sociotechnical system

- What you plan to do and build

- What you will need to accomplish your plan (has anyone previously tried to mitigate this harm? data? infrastructure?)

- Your plan for the rest of the semester to complete this project, including any internal deadlines you will need to meet to accomplish your plan

- Who will do what

# Submission

You will submit your code of conduct via Gradescope as a group. Gradescope has a rubric with points for this assignment. Make sure to enter all of your teammates in the prompt when submitting. You will be graded as a group. It should be one page (in a reasonable format like 12pt, single-spaced), with an absolute maximum of two pages.  If you do reference any work that’s not your group’s (this is not required), it should be cited; any citation format is acceptable.

# Rubric

* [2 pts.] Includes a relevant sociotechnical system and a harm in that system you can plausibly analyze and/or address
* [3 pts.] Clearly lays out what you plan to do and build, and how you will either analyze a harm or deploy an app or algorithm that helps mitigate that harm
* [2 pts] Clear plan for how to accomplish this in the rest of the semester, including what you will need to accomplish your plan, and who will do what
* [1 pt.] Features clear and cogent writing
